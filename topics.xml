          MANY CHERRY TREES
          SHIPPED BY MIKADO
          JAPAN SENDS U. S. OVER 2000
          FINE SPECIMENS
          Many Saplings from Orient Will B«
          Planted Along Potomac and Riv
          erside Driveways Mrs.
          Taft Recipient
          WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.—When tha
          honorary commercial commissioners of
          Japan arrives in Washington, Novem
          ber 1, they will be taken on an auto
          mobile ride which will include Poto
          mac drive, along which 2000 cherry
          trees to be presented to this country
          by the emperor of Japan are to be
          planted.
          The shipment of the trees and the
          planting thereof have been entrusted
          to Toraklro Watase, proprietor of a
          Tokio plant and seed company, who
          is one of the commissioners.
          Speaking of the gift of the emperor
          to the city of Washington, Mr. Watase
          said the trees would be sent to Mrs.
          Taft, wife of the president, and by
          her presented to the government for
          transplanting- along- Potomac drive.
          Former President Roosevelt and
          President Taft are chiefly responsible
          for the improvement of the Potomac
          river front, and it was Mrs. Taft ivho
          gave the name Potomac park to that
          section of the city. She made popular
          the afternoon promenades on the drive,
          which were a feature last year of
          summer life in the capital.
          New York Remembered
          The emperor of Japan Is sending to
          New York also a large number of
          cherry trees to be planted along River
          side drive and Grant's tomb.
          In Japan, the land of the cherry
          blossom, there are many beautiful
          legends about the trees and flower of
          the cherry.
          The blossom of the Japanese cherry
          is of a peculiarly delicate beauty, and
          there is a tradition in Japan that if
          that same tone appears in the blos
          soms of the Japanese cherry planted
          in another country, that country can
          he taken and subjugated by Japan.
          Mr. Watase is authority for the
          statement that while many Japanese
          cherry trees have been brought to the
          United States, the color of the bloa
          eoms, although just as beautiful, is
          unlike the blossom which appears in
          Japan.

          Down at the Tidal Basin, the other
          side of the Monument, a galaxy of
          Japanese cherry trees are Is full and
          fragrant bloom blooms that are try
          Ing to say with U. their delicate
          pinkness and sweetness that -spring
          Is here, that they live "but to weave
          garlands for her costumes and
          wreath lor her hair.
          Yesterday every member of the
          Japanese embassy made a pilgrimage
          to the- cherry trees from their own
          far-away country stood In wonder
          and delight at the sight of the flowers
          they love so well. It was like being
          transported "back to Japan for a few
          happy moments, they said.
          But it's only a sample of what
          Japan really looks like, they declare,
          for In their country the trees are tea

          A FEATURE of unique beauty
          which distinguishes Washington
          and Potomac Park over all cities
          and parks in this country is the
          how of Japanese cherry blossoms. No j
          other city or park has anything comparable
          to or approaching the great

          On April 4, ll>oo. exactly a month]
          after coming to the White House to live.
          Mrs. Taft had the tlrst eighty trees
          bought and planted between l'olo Field
          and the river bank, and every season
          since thev have rewarded her by the j
          most profuse blooming. Hearing of her
          interest in his country's cherished bloom.
          3>r. Jokich Takamine, a Japanese resident
          of New York, offered Mrs. Taft
          2.000 cherry* trees to plant in the pleasure
          ground, and the offer was accepted. The
          trees arrived from Japan in January,

          destroyed by the plant inspectors of the I
          Department of Agriculture. Dr. Takamine
          cabled for more, and 3.020 trees c
          arrived in 1311 and passed ail the tests t
          and inspections. Both consignments
          were offered in the name of the city of t
          Tokio in order that Washington, like t
          the Japanese capital, might enjoy such i
          a riverside avenue as the Mukojima and

          flower of Japan," and i( one says
          "flower." without specifying, cherry I J
          blossom is always understood. It is the
          national flower, the symbol of j
          purity, the emblem of chivalry ami j
          knightly honor, the crest of a cult j t
          whose vernal celebrations have been g
          observed with unflagging zeal for at j
          j least two thousand years. It is Ja- s
          pan's own flower, more omnipresent t
          than the chrysanthemum and indige'
          nous to the soil of the wild Yamato 1
          hillsides and to the heart of the c
          "home provinces"' that surround Kara c.
          i and Kioto. In the early centuries i
          Yamato rulers brought branches of
          1 sakura back from their hunting par-
          f ties in the mountains and planted a
          i them in the palace grounds. f
          In the fifth century the emperor and
          his eourt used to go to the "Palace fc
          of the Young Cherry Trees." near
          Nara. to view the blossoms and make
          boating excursions on the cherrybordered
          lake. The court had garden
          parties in their honor and the custom
          continues to the presenl day. and
          all the empire is given over to holiday
          pleasures while the sakuras are
          on. Millions of poems have been
          written to the cherry blossoms and
          tied to the branches of blossoming

          iron of those days, the "Napoleon of j
          /Japan,'* held a cherry blossom and j
          'poetay party of ten thousand guests,
          at his golden palace on Momoyama
          one spring, and again had as many
          assembled to do honor to the trees
          at Yoshino, In Vamato. the very home
          of the sakera, the classic spot where
          all the hills and ravines are masses
          of pink and white bloom and there
          are "the ten thousand trees at a
          glance" as one arrives, and as many
          more in other famous views.
          All the 130 varieties have been
          evolved from the little five-petaled
          flower of the Yama or wild cherry of
          the mountains, even to blossoms as
          large as a fTherokee rose and to great
          rosettes of "many-fold." "hundredpetal"
          and "thousand-petal" flowers.
          By grafting, and with p?-;irh'and pear,
          other qualities have been secured,
          but there always remains the distinctive
          heart-shaped petal with the indentation
          on its edge as if nipped by a
          sparrow's beak. Artists and artisans,}
          painters, decorators and designers
          have employed the flowers and buds
          of the cherry more than any other
          one motive, and in Japan one is never
          without such representation in sight,
          !n heraldry, ornament of every domestic
          utterance.

          "Will Mrs. Taft accept a thousand

          j asked Dr. Takamine. "Please find

          two thousand trees. She will need

          Kut, alas! When the two thousand
          little trees had been delivered to the
          American auth<*t-ities at the Seattle
          docks and loaded into refrigerator
          cars, to secure an even temperature
          during thoir ride across the northwest.
          and had been safely landed in
          Washington, the experts of the Department
          of Agriculture, decided that
          they were infected and infested with
          all sorts of scale insects and larvae
          and ordered them destroyed. It was
          a sad blow to Dr. Takamine, who at
          once cabled to have three thousand
          trees gathered and kept under observation
          for shipment the next spring,
          and also to delay the shipment of
          two thousand cherry trees, which, being
          offered to the park commissioners
          of New York by Prince Kuni during
          the ceremonies of the Hudson-Fulton
          celebration, had been accepted, Dr.
          Takamine paying the bills.
          In 1911 the second whinmint of
          cherry trees arrived arid passed all
          the inspections and tests in Japan
          and in this country. Dr. Takamine
          offered the services of his Japanese
          gardener for planting the twelve va1

          with age-long garden tralitions
          in Japan, but such ?ii*i w?.?
          leclined. Of those 3,030 trees of
          welve varieties, 1,300 were devoted
          o an original plan of having them
          ;ntiroly encircle the Tidal Basin, ip

          varieties miklit reflect, their beauty
          in still water.
          few were planted in tlio White
          House grounds and some were
          sriven to Rock Crpok Park. Some
          1,500 trees were set in rows in a

          "Mrs. Taft yesterday superintended
          the planting of a collection
          of rare Japanese cherry trees on the
          speedway- which had been sent to her
          by the mayor of Tokio. One. she
          planted herself. The planting was
          unofficial, and was attended only by
          the Japanese ambassador and Visp
          countess Chinda. Col. Spencer Cosby
          and Miss Scidmore. The idea is to
          have a grove on the speedway." These
          e memorial trees were planted by Mrs.
          Taft and Viscountess Chinda in the
          e open space directly west of the John

          11 -THE park planters set the little
          i'l trees around the basin as closely
          i- as currant bushes, although some of
          the varieties will attain the size of
          elms if given room for their roots
          and a chance to spread their branches,
          f A Japanese gardener would have
          spareu lliai error. in 1*1.11 VII. 1714,
          Col. Harts, tho new superintendent of
          public buildings and grounds, was ap1
          pealed to, and during that and the
          following spring the cherry trees
          around the basin were thinned out
          almost halt, and these, with the re?
          serve 1,500 trees in the nursery
          h garden, were set out in the new land
          beyond the railroad bridge. They
          r reach now entirely around both water
          s fronts of the point, and include some
          f of the latest blooming varieties, so
          that even in May one may find cherry
          blossoms on the trees across from the
          city wharves. All those trees below
          the railroad bridge are__planted in
          close groups of fours, and cry aloud
          to be spaced and each tree given a
          chance to develop unhindered.

          well recognized varieties of the
          "utsuku-shiki sakura" (beautiful
          cherry tlower) of Japan, twelve varieties
          best suited to this climate and
          the moist soil of Potomac Park were
          chosen, tiio second shipment or gift
          differing slightly from the first one.
          I including more of the single and
          more hardy varieties. For this reason
          there are 1.S00 of the SomeiYoshino.
          the common yama sakura
          (mountain, or wild cherry), the first
          to bloom in the spring-, the tallest
          and most long-lived tree. In the lait
          week of March or the first week of
          j April the Yoshlno's pale pink single
          blossoms suddenly clothe the bare
          branches and exhale their faint perfume
          in the warm sunshine as they
          ring the basin 'round with clouds of
          rose color. A few days, and then. If
          the winds blow, come the marvelous
          "snowstorms that are not from the
          skies." and the ground is white with
          the millions of cherry petals. One
          is not to sit and admire these charming
          trees by sunlight alone. The true
          flower-lover will never miss the
          chance to see them by moonlight and
          more enchanting still, by dawn. In
          Japanese cities the cherry trees in the
          public parks have an especial illumination
          by electric lights strung for
          .such effects. 111at those who must toil
          by day may have the greater pleas-
          ure under "the night trees." and the
          grand old ".Maruyama cherry tree."
          the (Jion tree in Kioto, a veteran.
          drooping Voshino-zakura, HO years
          old. has an illumination by flaming
          pine knots in iron cressets that is
          most unique. This wonderful old
          tree, once the loveliest in all the Kioto
          neighborhood, has begun to fail. It
          has lost many branches and much of
          iits great spread of canopying flowerclouds
          and soon will have to be replaced
          by a successor. Meanwhile,
          the guardians of such things are concentrating
          on worthy successors, and
          the next ideal and popular tree undoubtedly
          wjll be a drooping Yoshino
          cherry, already enthroned on a raised
          circular terrace in the zoological gardens.
          Such trees when they once
          show the disposition or the constitution
          to he something remarkable are
          watched and trained, trimmed and
          fed, pampered in a dozen ways to secure
          their perfection and make them
          worthy of popularity. Have any of
          the trees in Potomac Park been singled
          out in this way for future'belleship
          among the .1.100 beauties, in
          good Japanese style?
          After the first burst of Yoshino blossoms
          in the first days of April there I

          Celebratior
          EASTER, the most extensively ob- i
          served of all Christian celebra- 1
          tions; may be said to have had j
          its true origin previous to any
          authentic history of mankind. True 1
          enough, it is kept in commemoration j
          of the resurrection of Christ, and is
          the most elaborately celebrated at
          Jerusalem, around which centers
          much of the history of the life, teach- j
          ings, death and resurrection of the
          Savior. Year by year many nations i i
          of the earth go up to this ancient I 1
          city. All turn to the sacred shrines J
          as a common home, there to celebrate
          the ceremonies of holy week.
          In the Church of the Holy Sepulcher 1
          there is a spot Invariably pointed out J
          by the guides as the center of the
          world. This the devout people who J
          make their yearly pilgrimages be-
          lieve implicitly to be the exact spot, j
          for Jerusalem is the center of the
          religious world, and for Christians of
          every description the Church of the
          Holy Sepulcher is the center of in- j
          terest.
          The rites of holy week are presided
          over by a patriarch, who is the recognized
          master of ceremonies. He appears
          in gorgeous robe with diamondset
          cross and icon upon his breast
          and jeweled crown of gold upon his
          head. The whole scene of the gospel
          story is portrayed with ceremonies f
          during the week. One remarkable r
          ceremony is that of the. holy tire,
          I which takes place on Saturday. It is 5
          I claimed hy the patriarchs that fire r
          comes down from heaven on that day f
          to light their lamps, and if extin-
          guished they will be immediately re- 1
          lighted. s
          Services of the week close with
          Master mass, in the Church of the
          Holy Sepulcher, beginning at mid- s
          night Master eve and extending well t
          toward the dawn. At the sound of
          bells announcing the close of the f
          service the pilgrims go out into the
          fresh morning air to watch the com- v
          ing of Master day and dream of the p
          beauties and mysteries of religion as r
          it has come to them through crude p
          teachings and ancient superstitions of 0
          the eastern churches. j.
          f
          Mexico has her holy .week. too. t
          celebrated with pomp and splendor, J
          sad devotions and old customs that f
          still linger in the land of Montazuma.
          The people go from all points p
          of the compass, far and near, on their h
          rtilirrimn trn tn Cnarl^l nnp thA I C
          holiest shrine of all Mexico, where
          they congregate in immense crowds. c
          There the descendants of a nation n
          sunk in paganism for centuries after c
          the Crucifixion meet to celebrate the c
          Divine Tragedy that was enacted in
          Syria nineteen hundred years ago. h
          The most solemn week of ail the s
          weeks of tlie year is Passion week in tl
          Mexico City. Images, icons and s;
          crucifixes are to be found every- ti
          where. The most remarkable of the nr
          ceremonies is the blowing up of n
          Judas. The betrayer is represented o
          as a misshapen monster. Hundreds ft
          of his images are sold on Good Friday.
          They are filled with explosives ir
          which blow the doomed figures to ri
          atoms when let off on Saturday morn- a
          ing and the homely arch-traitor goes tl
          up in smoke. tl
          The Moravian churches of this ir
          country have their Passion week, with tr
          somewhat peculiar rights. They set- ni
          tied in Pennsylvania and North Caro- st
          lina. At Bethlehem and other places ti
          in Pennsylvania they are the pre- st
          dominating religious sect. At Salem,
          N. C., they established a very inter- sc
          osting and unique colony in 1753. ai
          There they have a strong church and pi
          one of the finest colleges in the coun- a
          try. Religious service is a daily oc- ir
          currence in the church during Pas- ?j(

          istered and many of the younger set a
          are confirmed. fja Saturday, the is

          Ariake (dawn), whose rosy whil
          flowers have tiny brown leaves as a<
          companiments.

          T)Y mid-April there bloom the pn
          cious twenty-three of Mikurumi
          gayeshi ("looking backward froin tl

          Also, in mid-April, bloom the eight
          trees of Joko, a variety of pale pin
          and very fragrant flowers, and tl
          fifty trees of Fukorokujin ("god i

          may enjoy n continuous show

          pnt and diliatory cherry niossorr
          somewhere along the river drives eve
          far in May. In Japanese hands, tb
          sakuras are closely watched and fe
          and pruned and trained to grow i
          graceful lines. All these in Potoma
          Park are grafted on good stroni
          long-lived, wild cherry stocks, an
          certain varieties are good for a hur
          dred years. The drooping, the Ihrea
          and willow-branched trees are tb
          most graceful, and the "thousand
          fold" and "hundred-leaf" blossoms tl:
          most beautiful, but unfortunatel
          these double and double-double flow
          ers are borne by short-lived trees am
          in .thirty years or so. the branch*
          begin to decay and must be removei
          and soon the whole tree has to go.
          However, thanks to the energy an
          interest of Mrs. Taft and the get
          eroslty of Dr. Takamine, we have tb
          trees at last, and they are just no'
          in youthful perfection and will r?
          main a feature of wonderful beaut
          for one generation at least.

          The Statue for IKevr York Harbor.
          A French paper eaya The colossal
          statue of "Liberty Lighting tho
          World, erected by France and Ameri
          ca in remembrance of their old friend
          ship, is coming ont little by little from
          the immense workshops established
          expressly for its construction in the

          are at work. The first sentiment in
          spired by tho enormous head, nearly
          thirty feet high, is almost terror. Its
          gigantic dimensions are stupefying; but
          ujr uegrees mo eye Decomes accustomed
          to the colossal forms, and the mind
          reconciles itself to the extent of those
          great lines, and we discover in the midst
          of them the majesty and the light
          which the author has endeavored to give

          OUR PARIS LETTER.
          The head of the new Colossus,
          *'Liberty," which is in future to
          light all nations into the harbor of
          New York, has produced a profound
          impression on the visitors to the
          Exhibition. It is placed on the
          left-hand side of the grounds of the
          Champ de Mar's, looking towards
          the Seine. The face is very fine
          somewhat resembling that of the
          Apollo Belridere, and the effect from
          the othr side of the grounds, two
          thousand feet off, or so, is remark
          ably grandL- For the first time a
          modern sculptor has achieved that
          in which the' Greeks seemed to fink?
          no difficulty whatever, namely, the
          necessary exaggeration of parts to
          produce effect at a great distance.
          M. Bartholdi has had a great success
          so far. The astonishment of the
          mass of visitors is amusing, and
          their presence serves to bring out to
          an observer the full grandeur of the
          work by comparison. A staircase
          is established within the head, and
          hundreds of visitors ascend every
          hour, while thousands wait their
          turn. The staircase leads up to the
          eyes of the figures, which serve as
          windows. From head to foot, half
          the height of the Monument of Lon
          don the arm which holds a "flam-
          beau," that is to say the lantern of
          the lighthouse, measures forty feet
          but the details read even more curi
          ously. Thus, the arms measure
          riearly seven feet in diameter, the
          hand is more than fourteen feet
          long, and twenty inches in diameter
          lastly, the finger nail measures more
          than fourteen inches by twelve. The
          platform which is to surround the
          lantern, will measure nearly four
          feet in width and will hold ten per
          sons, and allow space for them to
          circulate without difficulty. The
          head is surrounded by rays] whicit.
          lire to be illuminated.

          Public sentiment hbar been thorough
          ly aroused at last, ini favor of the move
          ment toward the erectingof Bartholdl's
          statute, "Liberty Enlightening the
          World," inu the harbor of New York.
          Americans now understand that those
          among them who subscribe to the
          completion of this grand work, will
          perform an act of patriotism, and at
          the same time one of International
          comity worthy of the enlightened
          ideas permesting this nineteenth
          century.
          Some idea of the extent of the pub
          lic sentiment is shown by the fact tbat
          the New York World has been able to
          report subscriptions of over $30,000 in
          a month's time, in sums averaging
          less than $1" each, the great bulk of
          these contributions being in dimes
          and quarters.
          What a aiagniflcent object it will be,
          towering almost into the clouds from
          New York's beautiful harbor I It will
          stand as a grand symbol of liberty be
          fore the eyes of every one coiaiug froll
          the oppressed countries beyond the
          ocean. At the gateway of no other
          nation oould it stand with such ap
          propriateness. Here it symbolizes the
          fullest achievement of human freedom
          and will forever stand to tell that story.
          The committee in charge of the erec
          tion of the pedestal for the reception
          of this great work have prepared a
          beautiful statuette, as a souvenir tb
          send to eob person who sab uilbe
          Ought not the beat of every A
          can to respond with pride when be
          bas the opportunity of contributing
          toward the erection of such a monou
          ment
          It is one of the grandest undertak
          ings of modern times and eminently
          fitting that it should be built from the
          hearts and pockets of our people.
          The committee does not believe the
          American people are indifferent to
          this great work, therefore calls upon
          them for their aid. Every person
          wishing to secome a sobscribershould
          soend their address to Richard Butler,

          BARTHOLDI'S STATUE.
          Liberty Enlightening the World.
          This now Wonder of the World, which is
          now being loaded on the French transport lsere
          for shipment to this country, is tho largest
          statue in tho world. Somo idea of its magni
          tude may bo obtained from tho fact that 40
          persons found standing room within the head.
          A six-foot man standing on tho level of tho
          lip3 only just reached the eyebrow. Whilo
          workmen wero employed on the crown of her
          head they seemed to bo making a huge sugar
          caldron, and they jumped with caso in and out
          tho tip of tho nose. Fifteen pcoplo might sit
          round tho flame of tho torch, which elevation
          can bo reached by a spiral staircase within tho
          outstretched arm.
          Tho London Daily Ncics, in speaking of it,
          says It is out aud away the largest statue of
          modern times. Tho Colossus of Rhodes was
          nothing to it. It could carry tho 'Bavaria' or
          tho 'Hermann' in its arms. It towers to tho
          skies from tho yard of the Ruo do Chazelles,
          whoro it has been eight years in construction,
          and tho view from its coronet sweeps clear of
          the six-story hbuses and beyond tho walls of
          Paris."
          Tho weight of this stupendous statuo is 440,
          000 pounds, of which 170,000 pounds are cop
          per and tho remainder wrought-iron. It is
          expected to arrivo in New York about the 25th
          of May, whero it will bo erected ou Bedloe's
          Island, this being the location selected for it by
          Gen. W. T. Sherman, who was appointed by tho
          President to mako the selection. When placed
          in position it will loom up 305 feot above tide
          water, tho hight of tho statuo being 151.2 feet,
          that of tho pedestal 91 feet, aud foundation
          52.10 feet.
          This imposing statue, higher than tho enor
          mous towers of the great Brooklyn Bridge or
          the steeple of Trinity Church, which is tho
          loftiest in tho city of New York, higher, in
          fact, than any of tho colossal statues of anti
          quity by its rare artistic proportions, as well
          as by its stupendous dimensions, will add an
          other to tho Wonders of the World. A word
          should bo said of its artistic "merit. The pose,
          stride, and gesture, with its classic face, aro
          pronounced perfect; the drapory is both mass
          ive and fine, and in some parts is as dclicato
          and silky in effect asif wrought with a fino
          chisel on tho smallest scale.
          The committco in charge of the construction
          of the baso and pedestal for tho reception of
          this great work aro in want of funds for its
          completion, and have prepared a miniaturo
          statuct, an exact counterpart of tho original,
          six inches in hight, tho ilguro being made of
          bronze, the pedestal of nickel silver, which
          they aro now delivering to subscribers through
          out tho United States for tho small sum of $1
          each. Aside from its being a lasting souvenir
          of this colossal statue, it will ornament onr
          homes and bear testimony that wo have con
          tributed to tho completion of ono of the grand
          est works of&amp;modcrn times. All remittances
          should bo addressed to, Richard Butler, Secre
          tary American Committee of the Statuo of Lib
          erty, No. 33 Mercer Street, New York. Tho
          committee aro also prepared to furnish a model,
          in samo metals, twelve inches in hight, at $5
          each, delivered.

          BARTHOLDtni BIG CIRC.
          T&amp;e Prejudices Met By a Canvasser
          the Pedestal Fund.
          The Bartholdi pedestal fund is nearly
          complete. The statue has arrived and
          soon New York harbor will be graced
          by the most magnificent colossal statue
          the world has ever seen.
          "Liberty Enlightening the World!"
          What a priceless blessing personal li
          Derty is. It is the shrine at whiclf
          people, ground under the heel of ty
          ranny in the older worlds,, worship
          with a fervency that Americans can
          scarcely realize it is a principle for
          which Nihilists willingly die the death
          of dogs andfitand proper it is that
          at the very entrance of the Bay of New
          York this emblematic statue should
          flash a welcome to the world.
          The press is entitled to the credit of
          this achievement Mr. Philip Beers,
          who has been making a circuity of the
          country on. behalf of the Pedestal fund,
          says that the fund will certainh be
          raised, as the World does not know the
          fail.
          Mr. Beers says that he has found the
          most pronounced generosity anion*
          those of foreign birth. They seem
          more appreciative of liberty than
          do our native born Moreover,
          among some a strange prejudice seems
          to exist
          "Prejudice?' In what particular3*'
          "I have ever found that however
          meritorious a thing may be, thousands
          of people will inevitable be prejudiced
          against it I have spent most of niv
          life on the road and I know the Ameri
          can people 'like a book.' In 1879 a
          personal misfortune illustrated this
          prevailing prejudice. I was very ill,
          had suffered for several ears" with
          headache, iickle appetite, dreadful
          backache, cramps, hot head, cold hands
          and teet and a general break down of
          the system. I dragged mj self back to
          New York, seeking the best profession
          al treatment. It so happens that among
          my relatives is a distinguished phys
          cian who upbraided me roundly "for
          preaching so much about rus own case.
          Finnallv, with some spnit, I remarked
          to him:
          '"Sir, you know that much of jour
          professional wisdom is pretense. You
          are controlled by prejudice. You
          cannot reach a case like mine and you
          know it. can you?""
          "I had him and he finally conceded
          the point, for it was bright's disease of
          the kidneys which had prostrated me,
          and the schoolmen admit they jjcannot
          enre it. Having cured myself, howev
          er, in 1879, and not having seen a sick
          day since, my relative finally admitted
          that Warner's safe cure, which accom
          plished this result, was really a wonder
          ful preparation. Had President Butter,
          the Central-Hudson used it, I am
          certain he would be alive to-day, for he
          could not have been in a worse condi
          than I was."
          "I have found similar prejudices a
          mong all classes concerning even so
          laudable a scheme as the pedestal
          fund."
          Mr. Beers"s experience and the re
          cent death of President Butter, of the
          Central-Hudson railtoad, of an extreme
          kidney disorder, proves that the phjsi
          cians have no real power over such dis

          lings, back ache, dark and offensive
          fluids, prematurely impaired ej esight,

          "Yes, sir-ee, every cent needed for
          the pedestal will be raised. Of course
          it will be a great triumph for theare
          World, but would it not have been an
          eternal disgrace had our people failed
          to provide for this pedestal?"

          afternoon, aa if in compliment to the ihi'imi il
          larne crowd of visitors to Bedlow'a Island. Tl
          Steamer Jud Field instr-ad of reappearing, i
          ?was promised, was put through auothei course
          repairs, and the bil, steamer Water Lily took ht
          place, to thc gre.U delight of all who have to truvi
          often to the statae's out-of-the-way ait<\
          The island itself looks fresher and cleaner tliiin
          hue tor wooka. The grind stand and the sneaker
          platform mild.) tho parapets are all np. Tho ran
          parts have buen clear 3d .'ind levelled on the tor
          and eidea SBsl sown all over with ("rsSB-aSfM
          which shows signs here mid there of beginning t
          ?prout. The unsightly old boards havo bee
          burned and the loose sto ios Bad rubbish from th
          Work al! carted back to tho gollies at tho island
          western tn.I. The hammering is still kept up o
          the right arm and anon Ider-blade of the Goddos:
          but practically, the great figure is ready for ur
          veiling any tiny.
          A bigger mask will be put. over th* face and th
          ?whole head will bo veiled with Ihe French tiicolo
          to-morrow. Ihe mask had taken away soincfhin
          of the ligure's finer suggestion and btoken sadly th
          delicate arch of the neck and graceful balance o
          the head. Yesterday under the warm southern sun

          a deafening dinof whistles, booming
          cannon, ringing of hell-, and -hout- of
          people sent the news that President
          Cleveland ami his party were nearing
          the island. As the cutter Despatch with
          the President on board made Its way
          through the harbor the yard- of all the
          men-of war were manned, and the pre-i
          dential salute of twenty-one guns waa
          given. In a few momenta President

          and fully fifteen minute- longer the noisy

          At 8:80 the whistles again began to
          screech, and kept it up for nearly ten
          minutes, within which interval the tri?

          During the period covering the speeches
          on shore the boats and ship-of the fleet
          bobbed on thc tide and awaited the end.
          It came shortly before "i o'clock, when

          A -larboard broadside was fired from
          all the ships in thc fleet,strong enough,sb
          an old mariner said, "to sour all the milk
          in creation." A quarter of an hour later
          th" signal for "down colors" wa- piped
          on the flagship, and the other ships called
          down their bunting ami ran up their stay I
          lights. At the same time the navy-vanl

          THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.
          HOW IT WAS. MAIiK ANI PUT IN 1T.ACI'..
          Tho Now York Tribune thus ro
          vlowfl tho history of the great work of
          M. Bartholin which was unveiled ou
          Thursday of last week in tho Now
          York hnrhor.
          Tho history of tho Ilartholdi stntuo
          from iiri"t to last is a checkered ono and
          goes back through nil sorts of delays
          and difficulties lor almost twenty yoaw.
          It was, strangely enough, just at tho
          closo of tho disastrous war with Ger
          many and while tho horrors of tho
          Commune wcro still raging in Paris
          that M. Lahoulnye, tho founder of tho
          French-American Union, first definito
          ly broached his jutriotio project of
          building in this country a joint memo
          rial of the struggles of tho French and
          Americans in tho Uovolution, and sent
          tho young sculptor Bartholdi to thu
          United States to find, if possible, Homo
          suitablo and happy idea. Tho first
          suggestion of tho statue, perhaps, dates
          still further back to a dinner given un
          der thu Empiro by M. Laboulayo at his
          country house, "Glavigny, near Ver
          sailles. St. l.AIIOUt.AYll's IIOI'KS AND I'ANCIKS.
          It was at that dinner nt Glavigny in
          1885, as Bartholdi himself says, that
          his mind was first turned in tho direc
          tion it was afterward so devotedly and
          enthusiastically to follow. The after
          dinner talk of 31. Iaboulayo's guests
          had fallen upon gratitudo between na
          tions. Soma ono said that such a thing
          as national gratitudo could not exist.
          Italy no longer felt grateful for tho
          good officers of France in 1859; even
          with the Uuiled States Franco could
          no moro count on tho remembrance of
          the past.
          This 31. Laboulayo stoutly protested
          against. Whatever might bo tho case
          witli Italy, he said, with America
          Francohad still a greater sympathy
          than with any European nation. Amer
          ica's feeling toward France, too, was
          not ono of simple gratitudo. It was
          based on tho lemenibranco of a, com
          munity of thought and struggles and
          aspirations. And when hearts had
          oneo beaten together something always
          remained behind among nations as
          among individuals. This, ho contin
          ued, was tho basis of tho sentiment
          felt in tho United States toward
          Frauce,a sentiment honorable to Amer
          icans as well as French, and if a mon
          ument weio to bo built in America as
          a memorial of independence it would
          bo most natural to havo it built by a
          united effort, to make it the common
          work of both nations.
          Fivo years after, in tho midst of tho
          war with Germany, Bartholdi found
          himself recurring again to this con
          versation. The war was soon over and
          his uative province, Alsace, shut against
          liim. Ho resolved to travel for a year
          and visit the country in which his in
          terest had been so sharply aroused.
          In a month or two ho found himself
          again at 31. Labotilaye's house near
          Versailles. With him were 31. Lafa
          yette, Henri 3Iartin, Bomusat, Volow
          ski and DeGaspariu. Tho talk turned
          onco more on tho feeling of America
          for France. 3L Laboulayo took up
          his old viows agaiu and declared that
          without a doubt by 1870 there would
          bo a strong pavdotio and French inovo
          raent in America.
          'Go to seo that country," he said to
          Bartholdi. "You will study it, and
          bring back your impressions. Pro
          pose to our friends over there to tuako
          a monument in commcn in remem
          brance of tho ancient friendship be
          tween France and tho United Slates.
          Wo will take up a subscription in
          France. If yon find a happy idea, wo
          aro convinced that it will bo successful
          on both continents, and wo shall do a
          work which will have a far-icaching
          moral effect.
          Bartholdi tells all this in his modest
          little sketch of the work of tho French
          Committee. And in thepo two convei-
          satinns at 31. Labotilaye's the germ of
          tho French-American Union's project
          may bo found.

          Tho sculptor thought over noma

          31. Laboulayo had given him loiters of
          introduction, ho soon disoovercd that
          ho could look for support in the United
          States that, as ho says, the draft
          drawn by tho French Committeo on
          American sentiment would not ho pro
          tested. M. Laboulayo had had somo
          correspondence already with John Jay
          and others respecting tho monument;
          hut though tho interest which Barthol
          di mentions was no doubt arouset', no
          formal nction was taken until tho
          soulptor's second vis'r, here,

          Going back to France, Bartholdi run
          over his impressions lo 31, Laboulayo
          and his friends, and laid beforo them
          tho plan for a stntuo iu Now York
          harbor. Thoy udoptvd it with enthusi
          asm, A committee was organized tin
          der tho name of tho Fronch-Ainerican
          Union, and Bartholdi set to work to
          mako his first models. Tho full plan
          of tho Union was made public at tho
          and of 1871, and subscription lists
          wp0 soon peculating throughout
          Kiaiice. A good ileal of money oamo
          in at onco mid moro was promised.
          Tho actual moulding of tho hugo
          cast began in 1875, Tho birth of tho
          stntuo was celebrated on November Oth
          of that year by a dinner nt tho Hotel
          du Louvre, at which tint Aaicrioan
          Minister, 3Ir. Washbunu', and all tho
          prominent memhets of tho French
          Amerioan Union wcro present. Tho
          ritrht liund of tho goddess was struck

          to the Centennial Exhibition at Phila

          Bartholdi himself camo over in that
          year ns one of tho French jury for tho
          eihihitlon. Tho unveiling of his stat-
          no oi littayette, which was oruorcd by
          tho Fronoh Government as a gift to

          tho siege, nnd which now stands in
          Union Square, gavo him an opportuni
          ty to push matters among ins Now
          York friends.
          A call for a meeting nt tho Century
          Club was issued by William 31. Ev
          arts, John Jay, W. II. Wickham, S. D.
          Babcoek, William II. Appleton and
          Kiohard Butler. There tho plau of
          tho French committeo was talked over
          with Bartholdi aud Hocharabcau and
          an American committee was organized.
          .Mr. Evarte was its chairman nnd Rich
          ard Butler its secretary. Sub-committees
          wero appointed and weekly meet
          ings wcro held for a tnno. Tho ques
          tion of procuring legislation from Con

          firmed Bartholdi's choice. Fort Wood
          was given up as a military post and
          turned over to the uso of the Ameri
          can committee.
          TAnnv mtowTii ov the statuk.
          Bartholdi went back to Franco in
          tho fall of 187G Tho political crisis
          that camo toward tho end of 31ac3Ia
          hon's Presidency had bad a disastrous
          effect on tho affairs of the French
          American Union. Subscriptions had
          almost ceased to come in nnd word was
          sent to tho American committeo that
          tho work on the foundation and pedes
          tal of tho statue bad better bo post
          poned for a year or two. It was not
          until 1879 that money enough was
          raised in Frauco to pay tho baro ex
          penses of the work on tho statue.
          Iu 1878, however, Bartholdi, san
          guine nnd undaunted as ever, executed
          tho head for tho Paris Exposition.
          The other parts followed at intervals,
          and by July, 1880, tho French com
          mittee saw its way clear to report sub
          stantial progress to tho American com
          mittee aud to fix a probable date for
          tho completion of tho statue. On Oc
          tober 24, 1881, tho anniversary of the
          surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown
          all the pieces of tho framework and of
          tho baso were put in place, and Levi
          P. 3Iorton, then United States Minister
          to France, was invited to drive tho riv
          et of tho first piece which was to bo
          mounted. Tho statue was nearly fin
          ished in 1883, but tho work on the pe
          destal here was so backward that it
          was decided to leave tho completed
          goddess on exhibition for awbilo iu
          Paris.
          Finally, on July 4,lS84,Count Ferdi
          nand do Lessops, who had succeeded
          31. Laboulayo as President of tho
          French Committee, turned the statuo
          over iorracrlly to tho Unitod States
          through 3Ir, 3Iorton. It stood six
          months longer waiting for tho comple
          tion of tho pedestal. It seemed for a
          tlmo that it would havo to wait torov
          cr, and tho work of taking it down was
          beguu in January, 1883, with many
          misgivings. Tho pieces wero packed
          carefully in 210 cases and stowed on
          board tho French man-of-war Isero at
          Rouen. Tho statuo was insured for
          about half its value.
          Tho Isero had an extremely rough
          voyago nnd had to put back onco to
          Rouen to escape a storm. Outside tho
          harbor of New York sho was met by
          the French North Atlantic Squadron,
          under Admiral La Combe, and escort
          ed into tho bay with flying colors.
          The Isero reached Now York iu June,
          188.). Tho pieces of tho statue wero
          lightered over to Bedlow's Island and
          wero stored thero until 3Iay last, when
          the work ot setting up tho great cop
          per goddess for the last time was begun.
          Till! AMERICAN COMMITTEE'S TKIAI.S.
          Tho American committee could do
          nothing, of Course, after obtaining tho
          grant of a sito from Congress, but wait
          for tho signal from 31. Bartholdi and
          his friends to break ground for tho
          statue's pedestal. In 1882 somo pre
          liminary steps wero taken. A publio
          meeting was held in tho Academy of
          3Iusio on November 2i? of that year,
          and tho taking of subsciiptions was
          pushed vigorously.
          Iho Mow York Legislature passed a
          bill appropriating $."0,000 for tho work
          on tho pedestal. But Governor Clove
          land vetoed it, to tho great disgust
          of tho managers of tho Pedestal Fund,
          as unconstitutional. A still greater
          disappointment camo with tho winter
          ot lH84.ii. A bill appropriating SI 00-
          000 was introduced during tho short
          session of Congress, nnd failed through
          the neglect of tho Committeo on Ap
          propriations to insert tho item in their
          mat report.
          Work on tho foundation inside tho
          old fort was begun in tho spring of
          1883, an. I the loundnttou itself was
          finished hetoro tho end of that year.
          In tho spring of 1881 tho corner-stone
          of tho pedestal was laid, aud a fow
          tiers of granite wero nddod now nnd
          then from inonlh to month. Tho first
          bit of enthusiasm was over, and tho
          subscription list hung fire. Statuettes
          and photographs wero slruok off by
          tho committeo and offered for sale, but
          tho returns grow smaller nnd smaller.
          One hundred aud sovo'nty-fivo thous
          and dollars had been raised by tho
          summer of 188(, and tho committee's
          persuasive powers wero apparently ex
          hausted, Its run of bni luck could
          not ho broken.
          In 3Iarch, 1885, when tho statuo was
          almost ready for shipmeut, and tho
          American committee, in a state of
          thickening despair, tho Now York
          World unexpectedly undertook to
          raiso tho $100,000 Btill needed, and
          opened a subscription list of its own
          for that purpose. By Julv a total of
          S102, 000.30 was turned into tho Po-
          destal Fund. This tided tho commit
          teo over tho fall and winter of 1885,
          nun sorvoit, indeed, to hnUh tho mas
          sivo pedestal in April, 18S0.
          I ho iron framework nnd braces lor
          tho support of tho stntuo wero put up
          in may ami June, and on July l'.'th
          tho work on tho copper plating itself
          was begun, 3Inny of tho huge pieoos
          boxed up so long, shaken about in so
          many handlings nnd exposed to a great
          variety ot temperatures, had flattened
          out of their original shape. There
          was a great deal of delay from tltno to

          For tho last month or moro almost
          dally nolo has been mado of tho slow
          progress of riveting tho vast copper
          shout hi r together and tho gradual
          softening of tho heavy lines and sur
          faces which looked so coarso and vague
          aground, to tho easy, graceful, airy
          symmetry of tho splendid figure as it
          now stands. Tho statuo was practi
          cally finished on October 1G. From
          that day, at least, tho Amoricnn com
          mittee will always dato its first mo

          THE SITE AND TUB POUNIIATION.
          BjrthoHi himself choso Bedlow's Is.
          land fifteen years ago for tho sito of
          his great monument. No spot, in fact,
          could havo been n happier ono for tho
          purpose. From tho shores of the Bay
          tho level islet looks like tho mere natu
          ral baso of the vast statuo and its solid-faced
          pedestal.
          Cut away from any rival objects
          largo or small, dwarfed or dwaifitiir.
          tho colossal figure stands clearly against
          the freo back-ground of water, land
          and sky, bletidiug with them easily nnd
          simply, liko an imago drawn, as tho
          goddtss is, on their own scale. And
          if tho great bronzo figure Ills, liko ono
          of its own rivetB in tho copper sheath,
          into the surroundings of sea and sky,
          tho granite pedestal finds aready-mado
          support to tho double star-shaped inner
          walls of old Fort Wood
          Tho base of tho pedestal is almost
          hidden from the outside behind them,
          and when tho old parado ground is
          filled in, and tho sodded tcrraco slopes
          gently downward from the crown of
          tho foundation over them to the sea
          wall below, thoir tops will mako an
          easy break halt-way whero Iho stair
          cases will broaden out into spacious
          platforms, and benches will bo ranged
          for loiterers in tho pleasant weather.
          Tho outworks of tho fort have disap
          peared i so have tho powder-houses
          and tho sally-ports. Tho baBtions
          themselves will soon bo buried in tho
          dirt. Only the small sea battery with
          its guns freshly polished for display,
          net use, will be left to remind one in a
          year or two that Bedlow's Island was
          once a Govortiment post.
          The bulk of tho pedestal's founda
          tion will, of course, be out of sight
          when the landscape gardener has fin
          ished his work ou the approaches to
          tho statue. It starts, in fact, beneath
          the old parado ground, at thirteen feet
          above tho mean low water mark. In
          shape it is something liko a truncated
          pyramid, with a gentle slope.
          It does not rise, however, with a
          continuous wall, but with a series of

          greav layers oi concrete, each one a
          trifle smaller than the one it rests up
          on. Tho top reaches up above tho fort
          walls fifty-two feet ten inchos from tho
          baso. There is no break to the very
          top. The whole thing is a vast mass
          of concrete and rock, which measures
          on its upper face about sixty-fivo feet
          square.
          A WELL 11UILT PEDESTAL.
          Tho pedestal proper at its baso is
          sixty-two feet square, and begins at an
          elevation above tide-water or sixty-fivo
          feet. In the middle of each face, just
          on a leval with the proposed terrace,
          is doorway, fivo feet wido and thir
          teen feet high. On each-side of every
          door is a projecting disk of stone on
          which tho arms of the United States
          and of Franco will bo cut in lelief.
          Abovu the doors is a broad band of
          stono running around tho pedestal and
          broken into forty smooth faced medal
          lions, ten on each Bide, on which the
          coats-of-arms of tho various States will
          probably bo placed. Still higher than
          tho medallions aro four largo nanols.
          twenty-threo feet and six inches long
          and fivo feet and three inches from top
          to bottom. Theso will also bo covered
          with appropriate inscriptions and de
          signs.
          Whero tho walls io:n again thero s
          a jutting frieze of plain L-ranite, crown
          ed with a low open balcony on which
          lour aooi's open again Irom the shaft
          within. Hero tho third section begins.
          Tho walls contract several feet, though
          tho balcony rail breaks tho sharpness
          cf tho effect from below. It is but a
          few tiers now to the top of tho pedes
          tal, hid from viow by tho rich drapery
          of the goddess's tunic. Tho topmost
          platform is thirty-nino feet and four
          and threo eighths inches squaro and
          io leoi nuovo low-water m,rk,
          Tho pedestal is in its way a most
          graceful and modest structure. It, is
          neither monotonous or heavy, and has
          been raado to look smaller than it
          really is. Tho goddess, in fact gains
          n point ot elevation by this suppress-
          ion, and towers over everything else,
          but tho effect is in no wav forced or
          stilt-like. Tho soft gray shado of tl o
          pedestal blonds well with tho reddish
          brown of the copper, nnd the whiteness
          of tho rough quoins shows far aoross
          tho water in the slanting rays of tho
          early morning or lato afternoon sun
          Tho granite used is from a quarry on
          Leete's Isl.tnd in Connecticut, and tho
          size of the blocks mado tho building of
          tho pedestal ono of tho heaviest piooes
          of masonary over undertaken about
          New York. Gonoral Charles P. Stono
          was tho chief engineer of tho work.
          Richard 31. Hunt tho arceitect, and
          David II. King, Jr., tho builder. Tho
          pedestal cost in all about $250,000.
          COLOSSAL SIZE OF TUP. KIODKE.
          Tho Goddess of Libertv is tho larg
          est work of its kind that has over been
          completed. Tho legendary Colossus of
          lvhodcs could not possibly havo had
          tho shapo of bigness attributed to it.
          Tho colossal statuo ot Arnuntus, iu Ba
          varia, is about ninety-four feet in
          height that of St. Charles Borromco,
          on tho shores of Lake 3Iaggiore, sixty
          six feet. Tho Virgin of Puy comes

          Nr.w York, Oct. 28. The rain, which
          fell almost continuously for thirty-six
          hours, did not ce.ie until about daylight
          this morning. The sky did not clear,
          however, ami the thonautls of anxious
          sightseers who began to pour Into the
          streets at an early hour met. a I;imp, fos
          gy atmosphere, which threatened a re
          newal of rain at any moment.
          The storm greatly Interfered with
          the work on Bedloe's Island yesterday,
          but ns little t.t.s left to" do. it
          did not mailer very much whether it

          Between 8 and 9 o'clock all thorough
          fares showed signs of unusual activity.
          All trains were ciowded to their utmost
          capacity wilh people hurrying to advanta

          the procession wns to form, all was bustle
          and commotion as eailv as eight o'clock.
          Civic and military companies nriived
          faster than they could be assigned to their
          proper piaces.
          At a lew minutes past ten o'clock the
          head of the column began to move down
          Fifth avenue, led by the Fifth United
          States Artlllcrv and .Military Band. Then

          niore's famous baud. Then followed the
          Fiist Brigade, X. G. S. N. Y., acting as
          escort to the French column. The
          Fiench column contained ttie Socie'.e

          Then came another line band of music,
          which was followed by nearly a dozen
          moie Fiench societies. Behind the
          Frenchmen came the United Stale
          Judges and other high officials of tin:
          United Slates in carriages, and Governors
          ot Mates and Territoiics and other high
          dignitaries, also in carriages, who brought
          up the rear ot the second division.
          The third division was headed by
          Sheriff Grant as marshal, and was com
          prised of mayors of cities; a battalion
          of Philadelphia police; Brooklyn police:
          veterans ol the war of 1812; veterans of

          Then came the educational division: then
          mote military; Washington's carriage,
          drawn by nine lioies, escorted by the
          Continental Guard of Washington, and
          the old Washington Continental Guard,
          mounted. Firemen, Knights of Pythias
          and other organization's all helped to
          make up the other four divisions.
          As this brilliant column passed down
          Fifth avenue it was received by the enor
          mous crowds, which flanked it ou either
          tide with mighty cheers
          As the procession approached the re
          viewing stand at Madison Square, where
          President Cleveland and members of Ids
          Cab net were in waiting, a slight drizzle
          cf rain bi-gan falling, not enough, how
          ever, to disturb the crowd or spoil the
          spectacle.
          After passing through Martion Square
          the colnmn moved on down Fifth Avenue
          to Washington Square, where it turned
          into Broadway, thence dewu Broadway

          ment to the enterprise of the World, in
          raising the sum necessary for ralslug
          Bartholdi's great work.
          From Park Bow the route was again
          down Broadway to Courtlandt street and
          Maiden Lane, where most of the mili
          tary, turning to right or left, made their
          way to the river.
          The head of the procession reached the
          City Hall at noon. At the same time,
          whenever the iunIc of the bands ceased,
          the chimes of Trinity Church could be
          heard playing National airs of France
          and America.
          President Cleveland, accompanied by
          Secretary Bayard, drove to the reviewing
          stand at Madison square. He was fol
          lowed by Secretaries Whitney, Vilas and
          Lamar aud Colonel Lamout.
          Alter leaving Broadway at Cortlandt
          street and Maiden Lane, nearly all the
          military and civic companies made their
          way homeward.
          At this hour hoar (1:15 p. m.), the
          procession is still wending its way past
          the United Press office, 187 Broadway,
          having been over an hour in progress.
          All the vessels in North river are gaily
          decorated with flags, tho Great Atlantic
          liners being particularly noticeable as
          they lay at their docks, one mass ot color
          aloft.
          The naval parade, which forms another
          marked feature of the day, was set for
          one o'clock. The sound of the prepa
          tatory gun, which should have been fired
          at 12:45 p. m., was not heard until one
          o'clock, and there was considerable delay
          In getting the vessels which were to take
          part into line. Twenty minutes later the
          signal for the start was given, and tho
          vessels moved slowlv in double line from
          Forty-fifth street down North river, past
          a fleet of war vessels, toward Liberty
          Island. This procession was in charge
          of Lieutenant-Commander liich, and con
          sisted of two divisions. The first division
          was headed by the United Stales coast
          survey steamer Gciluuy, and consisted of
          all the larger vesels. The second divi
          sions consisted of tugs and miscellane
          ous crall of all descriptions. The ves
          sels presented a oeautiful sight as thev
          steamed down the Hudson. On i caching
          Liberty Island, they passed astern of the
          lii-m-ul-war anchored below the island
          then ill) between them and the island, till
          they came to abreast of the statue head
          on tide, where they remained at anchor
          until the end of the cetenionies ac that
          poiut.

          he was cheered, but when Bartholdi, tin;

          ognized by the mass, who had seen his
          portrait on programmes and in the il
          lustrated papers, a shout went up Irom
          those neatest the stand. The cry of
          "Bartholdi" was then caught np by both
          the reviewing Mid grand stands. The
          crowds on tin: avenue cuibings up and
          down heard the name and passed it to
          the people in the park and side
          sticets until the heavy air wns shaken
          with a i oar of cheering that must have
          gladdened the heart ol the Alsatian, who
          bowed his acknowledgments. Ami then,
          in carriages driven to the rear of the
          stand, came Mr. Cleveland and his party.
          Instantly lie was recognized, and again
          the crowds shook the welkin with their
          shouts, and from the housetops and win
          dows of hotels came shouts and sounds
          of clapping hands to swell Hie sound
          that like a wave broke over the park and
          flowed down tbc streets and along the
          avenue, where, in the misty distance, t lie
          trappings mid pomp of the head of the
          column was seen moving. The Signal
          Service operator at the Twenty-eighth
          Slnet station made known the fact to
          tiic throngs by a waving flag, and the
          pressure Increased toward the avenue
          and the people became packed more
          closely if it were possible.
          On the reviewing
          stand President
          Cleveland was pic
          sented witli three
          handsome baskets of

          The closing ceremonies iu the evening
          were a magnificent display of fireworks
          by James Payn, given on Liberty and
          Governor's islands, together with a
          grand illumination of French and Amer
          ican men-of-war. The pyrotechnic dis
          plays were the most wonderful and
          elaborate that have ever been witnessed
          iu this country. The funds for the fire
          works had been generously provided

          money for a fitting display of fireworks
          on the ocexsion of the unveiling of the
          great statue led Mr. Clews and the other
          gentlemen named to agree to furnish the
          uecessary money provided the displavs be
          given by James Pain, of Manhattan Bench,
          under the direction of the New York
          IPorid. When Mr. Pain was spoken to
          in regard to the matter he generously of
          fered to double whatever sum was raised
          by the patriotic friends of the statue and
          give a programme that would folly real
          ize their expectations. The ground had
          been gone over by an agent of Mr. Pain,
          nnd no trouble or expense was spared to
          make the displays the grandest
          ever witnessed In this country. The vast
          materials for the fireworks had been spe
          cially prepared for this occasion by Mr.
          Pain, and several new effects In pyro
          technics were introduced. The displays
          were begun with the lighting of the great
          torch for the first tinicl and were given
          simultaneoualy on Liberty and Govern
          or's islands, including some sixty sepa
          rate pyrotechnic pieces. With slight va
          riations the fireworks were the same on
          Liberty island and in front of old Castle
          William, on Governor's Island, and
          were set off by maroon signals from the
          statue. The displays were largely
          aerial and were vis
          ible from all parts of
          the harbor, although
          the best positions
          were the Battery and
          Brooklyn Bridge, or
          from the decksof ex
          cursion steamers
          midway between the
          two islands. The war
          ships weie anchored

          The yards and rigging were manned
          by sailors, and the marines were drawn
          up on the decks along the bulwarks.
          Brilliant calcium lights burned irom the
          extremities of the yards and fore and aft
          on deck, while the men stationed in the
          riggingand along the decks were supplied

          The famous statue, by Bartholdi, of
          "Liberty Enlightening the World" was
          received at New York, June 211, 1885.
          The Fiencli vessel Isere, wttli the statue
          on board, was escorted up the b-iy to
          Bcdloe's Island by a number of United
          States men-of-war and other vessels. The
          statue stands on Bcdloe's Island here
          after to be known as Liberty Island. At
          tlie entrance to New York haibor,
          Bartholdi, it is said, conceived the idea
          of rearing a colossal statue to symbolize
          America's message of liberty to the world
          whiie sailing up Aew lork bay on his
          vi-it to this country in 1871, with heart
          depressed at the itiin and wretchedness
          in his native land after her defeat bv Ger
          many. On his return to France he sug
          gested to his friends his idea of such
          a statue to be presented by the
          French nation to the United States.
          The idea was received with great favor,
          and so rapidly did subscriptions come
          iu that in 187(1 the sculptor began work
          upon his great statue. M. Bartholdi
          supervised every step of the work
          which was not only a
          labor of many years,
          but one lull of di!li
          culty and detail The
          first "steps toward its
          construction were
          made iu 1874, when
          the French-American
          union was establish
          ed, a banquet given
          and an appeal made to
          the people of France.
          In 1870 the sculptor
          began actual work.
          First the artist made
          his model in clay,
          and when this was
          approved a plaster
          statue was made; in
          dimensions it was
          one-sixteenth thesize
          THE TORCH.
          of the intended statue. Another plaster
          statue four times as large as the first, and
          a third one, of the full dimensions ol the
          finished work were made. The last
          modci hnd to be made iu sections, and a
          wooden frame-work was constructed on
          which the plaster was spread. When
          these sections were completed, wooden
          models were used, exact copies of the
          plaster In size and modeling. These
          were carcfnlly cut out by hand, and in
          them were shaped the hammered brass
          work which forms the outside of the
          statue. Eighty-eight tons of brass were
          used in the structure, and the entire
          weight of the statue is 450,000 pounds.
          In 187G M. Bartholdi, with the extended
          right arm of the statue the first part
          that was completed came to America
          and placed the arm and torch iu
          the Centennial Exhioition at Phila
          delphia, whence it was subscqnently
          removed to Madison Square, New
          York. In February, 1877, Congress set
          apart Liberty Island lor the statue,
          and a committee was chosen with
          William M. Evarts at its head. The
          face and head of the statue was com
          pleted in 1878, when it was placed in the
          FrcuchExposition.andouJuly 7, 1880, the
          great figure was com

          The history of the Bartholdi statue from
          first to last is a checkered one and goes
          bock through all sorts of delayB and diffi
          culties for almost 20 years. It was,
          strangely enough, just at the dose of tho
          disastrous war with Germany and while
          the horrors of the Commune were still
          raging in PoriB that M. Laboulayo, the
          founder of the French American linion,
          first definitely broached his patriotic pro
          ject of building iu this oountry a joint
          memorial of the struggles of the Frenoh
          and Americans in the revolution,aud sent
          the young soulptor Bartholdi to tho
          United States to find, if
          suitable and happy idea.

          The first sug
          gestion of the statue, perhaps, dates stUl
          back to a dinner given under the empire
          by M. Lnboulaye at his oountry house,
          Glavigny, near Versailles.
          The actual moulding of tho huge oast
          began in 1875. The birth of the statue
          was celebrated on November 6th of that
          year by a dinner at the Hotel du Louvre,
          at which the American minister, Mr.
          Washburne.and all the prominent members
          of the Frenoh-American Union wero
          present. The right baud of the goddess
          was struok off in Its oolossal proportions
          and sent to the Centennial Exhibition at
          Philadelphia in 1876.
          The statue itself was paid for by publio
          subscriptions of the French people. A
          bill accepting the statue and setting apart
          the site for the same pussod Congress in
          1877. Tho work of raising the rnouey to
          build the pedestal progressed slowly in
          this oountry until tho New York World,
          in March 1885, took the matter up aud
          opened a subscription list of its
          the purpose. By July a total of $102.006.39
          was turned over to tho committee and the
          E destal was finished iu April 1886.
          eanwhile the statue hail been brought
          to America on the French man-of-war
          Isere in the summer of 1885.
          Bartholdi himself ohose Bedlow's
          Island 15 years ago for the site of his
          great monument. No spot, in fact, could
          have been a happier one for the purpose.
          From the shores of the bay the level islet
          looks like the mere natural base of the
          vast statua and its solid-faced pedestal.
          Cut away from any rival objects, large
          or small, dwarfed or dwarfing, the colossal
          figure stands clearly against the free back
          ground of water, land and sky, blending
          with them easily and simply, liko
          image drawn, as the goddess is, on their
          nvn scale. Ard if the great bronze
          figure fits, like one of its
          oopper sheath, into tho surroundings of
          sea aud sky, the granite pedestal finds a
          ready-made support to the double star
          shaped inner walls of old Fort Wood.

          New York, Oot. 28.—The rain storm
          which prevailed all day yesterday ceased
          during tho night, but the weather this
          morning is very unpromising for the fes
          tivities whioh are to attend the
          tion of the Bartholdi statue. A slight fog
          hangs over the oity, and obscures, in a
          measure, the elaborate decorations of
          buildings with which the city has been
          beautified. French and Amerioan flags
          flying from house tops and windows
          in every direction, and a general holiday
          appearance is presented by moving
          bodies of soldiers, militia, civic orgamza
          tions, and by the collection on the aide
          walks of great orowds of people. The
          :__ _ the oity hall are very
          elaborate. Long streamers and flags have
          been hang from tho Federal bnilding oppo
          site along Mail street, through which
          the prooession will maroh, in order

          greens, flags and mottoes erected in front
          of the World Building, whioh i» taste
          fully deoorated with flags and bunting.

          is almost entirely suspended, the publio
          schools are closed and all New York is
          takiug part in the oelebration. Visitors
          from ail sections of the oountry have l>een
          ooming into the oity for 10 days past, and
          this morning thousands more were
          added to the ^great throng, the prospects
          of unpleasant weather in no way deterring
          them, tt is estimated that fully a million
          people will take part in the festivities.
          The multitude is simply enormous. Along
          the streets to be taken by the pro
          cession the ornsh is terrible and every
          window affording a view of the parade îb
          A iled with people. The head of the land
          parade is expeoted to reaoh the battery
          at noon. The naval parade will begin at
          1 o'clock.

          of workingmen and women, who usually
          tli read the streets at early morning hours
          carrying dinner pails and lunch baskets,
          were to-day as early astir, but with the
          difference that they wore their holiday
          attire, and their faces had expectancy in
          every feature. As early as 8 o'clook
          the tenement districts began the move
          ment toward the streets and avenues
          where they might see the pageant. They

          their homes to secure plaoes on the curb
          stones and street crossings. From a
          boundary line east and west at the river
          fronts the drift of people moved nntil
          when nearing the line of march there
          grew to l)e a tide of human beings that

          Gorgeously attired bands trailed the
          streets in silence seeking their detaoh
          ments, and drum oorpB beat the Btep for
          Grand Army posts, upon their uodden
          drum heads. The drapery of flags and
          bunting upon the oity buildings and upon
          the Federal building flapped fitfully in
          tho moist air, while the banners on thou

          lustily out in vagrant puffs of wind that

          kept a space clear for the distinguished
          f uests who were to oome with the P
          ent and his party and the French visi
          tors. Gilmore's band waB stationed be
          hind the crowd.
          It was 2.45 o'olook when the French
          delegation arrived at the island. With
          the exoeption of Count Ferdinand do Les
          seps, who asoendod the speakers' stand,
          they took seats on the platform on the
          front row. M. Bartholdi sat at the ex
          treme left of the line, with Mme. Bar
          tholdi at his side. Gen. Pelissier and
          Admiral Jaurès, in full uniform and glit
          tering with medals and orders, sat next.
          Then came Count de Lesseps's daughter,
          Mlta. Tototte, Mme. Max Leon. Deputies
          Spuller and .'Desmons, M. Villegente,
          Col. de Pusy, Col. de Laussedat, Director

          Robert, of the cabinet of the minister of
          public instruction; M. Desohtunps, vice
          president of the municipal council of
          Paris; M. Hielurd, of the Paris chamber
          of commerce; ex-Deputy Giraud, Charles
          Bigot, Napoleon Ney and Leon Meunier.
          Mr. Richard Butler in a few moments
          escorted M. and Mme. Bartholdi to seats
          on the speakers' stand, while the entire
          assembly oheered vooiferously. Most ol
          the other French guests
          the stand before the speaking began.
          Before thoy were all seated the thunder
          of a big gon boomed from the Tennessee,
          and then a great olond of steam ascended
          skyward while all the vessels opened up
          their whistles and made the air tremble
          with a deep-mouthed steam cheer. This
          tremendous burst of marine enthusiasm
          heralded the arrival of President Cleve
          land, who, looking bale and hearty and
          with his face wreathed with smiles, soon
          ascended the speukers' stand. He
          greeted by the assembly with long
          tinned cheers and the waving of hats and
          handkerchiefs. The President was accom
          panied by Secretaries Bayard, Whituey
          and Lamar, Postmaster-General Vilas,
          General Sheridan and Colonel Lament,
          nil of whom took seats bn the Speakern'
          stand. The Bartholdi Society arrived a
          few momenta later. Tho steam vessels
          continued to blow their whistles and
          Mile. Tototte held her hands
          and looks about her with an expros
          of wonder.
          Gen. Schofield stepped to the front of
          the speakers' stand and vainly waved his
          hat in the direction of the harbor in the
          hope that
          persuade the steamboat captains to cease
          their uproar. They would not cease, how
          time, and it was nearly
          half an hour before the last whistle uttered
          a final whoop and those on the platform
          able to hear what was being «aid.
          Gen. Schofield finally announced that the
          uses would begin with prayer by the
          Rev. Dr. Richard S. Storrs. Dr. Storrs
          offered up thunks for the lofty memorial
          which hud been reared by tho friendship
          of two great nations, and for all that it
          signified. Tho whistling continued all
          through the prayer and while General
          Schofield announced Count do LessepB
          behalf of the Franco
          various parts of the islund.

          clad i
          evening dress, and, pulling
          off his overcoat aud baring his gray hair
          to the fine penetrating rain, he stepped to
          the front of the stand. Tho crowd re
          ceived him with loud and prolonged ap
          much troubled by
          plause. At first he
          tluTuoise of the whistles, bnt this
          subsided, and os he spoke with great
          energy, iu a clear, ringing voice, aud with
          the «lean-out elocution of a skilful orator,

          limits of the crowd. His speech, which
          he read from manuscript, was listened to
          with close attention and frequently inter
          K ted by bursts of applause.
          do Lesseps retired amid great ap
          in the crowd propose« l
          given
          audible at the extreme
          plause. Some
          three cheers for him and they
          with rousing enthusiasm. Then General
          Hohofield introduced Senator William M.
          Evarts who made the presentation ad
          dress. Mr. Evarts was not heard dis
          tinctly by all the crowd and there were
          frequent cries of "Louder."
          A young gentleman standing near him
          the platform had been eagerly watch
          ing for the ond of his address. Away up
          in tbe mist and rain, on the head of the
          statue, were three men eagerly watching
          the young man near Mr. Evarts. The
          three mon were M. Auguste Bartholdi,
          Richard Butler, secretary of the Arneri
          coraiuittce, and D. II. King, who
          erected tho statue. They held in their
          hands the cord attached to the veil
          the face of the statue. The young
          down below held in his hand a white
          pocket hondkerohîef.
          above leaned far
          When Mr. Evarts paused for breath the
          young man beside him leaned far out and
          iooked up. Then he looked at Mr. Evarts
          and, seeing that tho speaker had paused,
          pulled out tho handkerchief and waved it
          madly. The three men above gave the
          oord a pull, aud tho veil fell from the face
          of Liberty. M. Bartholdi, shaken with
          emotion, turned and kissed aud embraced
          the two men with him.
          All the noise that had gone before was
          ohild's play to whut broke forth then.
          The whistles blew, the guns boomed, the
          bands played, the drums rolled, and the
          throngs on the island and
          shouted one thundering pman of accla
          mations that swept down the bay On the
          wings of the north-east gale and smote
          the hills of Staten Island with a huge
          shock of sound. Through the mist in
          every direction oouid be seen leaping
          sudden, Bharp flashes of light, and then
          the peal of guns eohoed aoross the water.
          It was the end of tho oration of Mr.
          Evarts. What he might have said had he
          spoken out of the fullness of his heart at
          that moment will never be known, be
          cause he sat down.
          When the outburst of guns and oheers
          was over Gen. Schofield said "Aooept
          ance of the statuo by the President of the
          United States." Oheers and applause
          greeted President Cleveland os he took
          off his hat and resting his left hand on
          the railing at the front of the platform,
          stood partly facing the crowd and partly
          the gatheriug on the sand. I e spoke in
          a strong, miuioal, and for-re-ohing voice,
          aud every word he said was distinctly
          heard by the entire gatheriug. He spoke
          as follows

          holds aloft the light that Illumines tb<* way
          to man's enfranchisement. [Cheers.] We

          rays, a stream of light shall pierce the
          darkness of ignorance and men's opp
          slon until liberty shall enlighten the world.
          The President's speech called forth
          long and loud cheers and applause, ming
          led with ones of "Good
          field next introduced Consul.General
          Albert Lefaivre, who spoke as the repre
          sentative of the republic of Franoo.
          After the applause had subsided there
          were calls for M. Bartholdi, who stepped
          to the front of the stand and bowed. His
          appearance was greeted with the wildest
          enthusiasm and mimerons demands for a
          speech. General Schofield exclaimed
          "Bartholdi says he won't speak. Thore's
          use of talking about it." lie then
          introduced Chanuoey M. Depew, who
          road the commemorative address. Mr.
          Depew wore a silk skull oap to protect
          his head from the raiu and had a tri
          colored rosette on the lapel of his coat.
          His speeoh called forth frequent and
          hearty applause.
          The long meter doxology was then sung
          by the entire assembly, and assistant
          Bishop Potter, olod in black robes, took
          off his mortar board hat and pronounced
          the benediction. A why was then made
          for the President and his party, who de
          scended from the platform and left the
          island. There was considerable delay in
          getting the crowds away from the island,

          Exciting: Scenes During: the De
          struction of Government Prop
          erty Valued at Nearly a Million.
          NEW YORK, N. V., June 15.— A fire
          started in tue biggest of the Government
          buildings at Ellis Island at 12:30 o'clock
          this (Tuesday) morning, and, spreading
          with frigbtinl rapidity, was at 1 o'clock
          sweeping over the whole island, and it
          seemed almost certain that every building
          would be destroyed.
          Telegraphic and telephonic communica
          tion was cut off, but the tire had lit the
          whole bay and every tug with fire ap
          paratus on board started for the island.
          By the time the police had started a great
          crowd had gathered at Battery Park. The
          flames were then shooting a Hundred tret
          in the air, and by their light hundreds of
          people could bo seen on the island rush
          ing hither and thither.
          There are usually more than 1000 per
          sons, most of them emierants, who sleep
          on the island. The customs officials
          thought the number there when the
          tire broke out less than 1000, most of
          whom arr ved on three ships yesterday.
          The officials thought tbe boats and men
          Bent to the island were enough to handle
          the immigrants who escaped from the
          burning buildings, no matter how scared
          they might be.
          At 1:15 o'clock a great crash was beard,
          and a moment later there was another
          tremendous shower of sparks flying into
          the air. When it had cleared a little it
          was seen that two walls of the main
          building had fallen in.
          For two minutes after this crash the
          crowds that had been seen on the island
          rushing around were lost sight of, but
          when the smoke cleared away it could be
          teen that a hundred or more tugs had
          reached the island and wore taking the
          people aboard. At this time every build
          ing and every shed seemed to be burning,
          and there was absolutely no shelter for
          the people anywhere. The beat was in
          tense. The whole island is|ooly six acres
          in area. The unfortunates were forced to
          crouch, fur on the cater edge until the
          ho: f'iv J.
          At 1:30 o'clock thf ferry-boat John G.
          Carlisle arrive 1 from the island with 200
          emigrants and all the sick patients from
          the hospital there. As the boat got to the
          pier a crowd made a rush for her. The
          i police charged on the great crowd and
          fought their way to the boat, the officer*
          ot the boat standing on tiie upper deck
          screaming. "We've got sraa'lpux patients
          aboard Go back go bick
          The crowd retreated pre.u>ita:ely. The
          Carlisail the nurses employed on the i>lund and
          by Mrs. Wtiite, wife of the resident phy
          sician. She said thnt when she boarded
          the boat she had not heart of any one
          being injured, and thought all the emi
          grants got out of the buildings safely.
          One of the oilu-ers of the boat said the
          fire originated in one of the lowers of the
          main building. At the time it started all
          the emigrants were asleep. The watch
          men sounded the alarms before they did
          unytuing towaid tiehting t: c fire, and in
          that way it >:ot such a great headway that j
          by the time they could turn their atten- j
          tion to it it was sweeping through the ram
          shackle buildings utterly beyond con'.rol.
          Tfie tire was first -een In the northwest
          corner of the building, which is the de
          tention building, by Captain W. J. Burke,
          who is in charge of the night watch.
          Burke said all the rtoms in the building
          are connected by an elecric alarm, and
          that ;ii qu.ckly as possitle he rushed to
          the main ollice and rang the alarm in all
          the rooms.
          This alarm, he said, summoned the
          eleven men and two women under him.
          There were at the time 110 in
          the main building. Cv the time these
          people got out the whole building, from
          tower to tower and side to side, was a
          n.as.3 of swirling flame?, whi< h shot hun
          dreds of feet in the a;r. Within a tew
          minutes after the fire started the miserable
          i water supply on the island was almost
          completely cv: off|v bthe bursting ol pipes
          which run along inside he main build
          i ing, so that when the first detachment of
          police arrived It was impossible to secure
          a stream of water with enough force to
          have any effeci.
          Just directly north of the main build
          ing stood the hospital in which were
          lifty-seven patients. Ihe admirable dis
          cipline of the nurses and medical staff
          i shov.-ed itself and the fifty-seven patients
          j were quickly wheeled or helped out of the
          building. One woman who was nursing a
          child suddenly lemembercd she had left
          her baby behind. She beat the air with
          her bauds and then tried to rush back
          into the flames. She was held back by
          tliree attendants. Presently the nurse
          came around with the baby in her arms.
          Every official a reporter saw on the
          i island said positively that no lives had
          i been lost. Ail the emigants were brought
          to the barge office lor tne night. Com
          missioner Seuner said he would person
          ally furnish a place for all sick emigrants,
          and the city hospitals would not be asked
          to take ttiem.
          Dr. Senner says the building* burned
          cost the Government $780,000. He does
          not know what accommodations can be
          arranged for the receiving of emigrants
          until they are rebuilt.

          Cook's order barring ou; bicyclists from

          THE FINE NEW IMMIGRANTSTATION ON
          ELLIS ISLAND—TO BE FINISHED
          BEFORE JANUARY
          The new Immigration Bureau on Ellis Island,
          which has been in course if erection since August, 1898, is nearing completion, and in its
          present condition makes an imposing appearance
          from the New-York shore. Although this is a
          United States building, it has not been erected
          under the direction of the Government Supervising Architect's office, but by the architects who
          received the award In a competition which was
          open to architects all over the United States.
          When completed, the new building will furnish
          roomy and pleasant quarters for the immigrants, where they may be examined, "assorted."
          forwarded or detained, and will In- a great improvement on the present cramped and inconvenient quarters at the Barge Office.
          The building is about 300 feet long and 100
          feet wide. The base is granite, and the building
          proper is brick, with limestone trimmings The
          flat roofs are covered with tile and the sloping
          roofs with copper. The structure is elevated
          about fifteen feet above the landing pier, and
          the distance from the place where the immigrants are landed to the main hall is about one
          hundred feet. This space is a glazed porch
          which will serve as a protection to immigrants,
          as well .is baggage, when they are transferred
          from the barges to the bui.ding. From this
          light and roomy vestibule the newcomers will
          go up a large stone stairway to the upper floor.
          where the Inspections will be made. This room
          is about one hundred by two hundred feet In
          size, and its arrangement, the divisions by wire
          screens, rails an-J partitions, were made after
          careful study of the experiences at the Barge
          Office during the last ten years.
          On the lower floor all the baggage will be
          taken care of. There will be a number of dormitories on the third floor, and the wings of the
          building will be occupied by offices.
          In addition to the main building there will be
          a hospital, a building containing baths and a
          restaurant, a kitchen and laundry building, a
          boiler house, physici ins" house and ferry houses,
          and these will all be connected by covered and
          protected walks. The bull lings will all be uniform in style of architecture and material.
          The architects, Boring &amp; Tilton, have provided
          f rroof gardens in the construi tion of the main
          building These are not positive features of the
          new building, but the roofs are so arranged that
          gardens may b built with little difficulty,
          The contractors are making good progress with
          the work, and hope to have it completed before
          next January. Th •
          cost •<( the structure will be
          about §I.I.MM>.< NM». which is only about "_ \u25a0

          Tb« architects, Borlnp Tilton. have tried In

          in RJC SI a teMhig. and give It besides, architect

          ml with Irnilar.a limestone and Maine granite. In

          THE EXAMINATION ROOM IN THE IMMIGRANT STATION ON ELLIS ISLAND.
          tlslom are similar. As In the first building, the
          examination* are conducted on the second floor and
          the baggage Is handled on the first floor. The big
          examination room Is two rtorles high. It Is the
          largect room in the building. On a level with the
          third floor a railed visitors' gallery runs around It.
          It Is fringed with the offices of the Immigration
          o9dala, rooms for the meetings of the Hoard of
          Special Inquiry, for records, for the Contract
          Labor Bureau and for more minute medical and
          contact labor examinations. The chief rooms on
          The tMrfl floor are dormitories for detained Immi
          grants.
          GOOD 6ANTTARY CONDITIONS.
          .Extrezas rare has been taken to have th* sanitary
          condiUcr.s as close to perfection as possible. The
          floors are of asphalt, with raised edges around the
          walls, so that they can be thoroughly cleansed with
          water. The walla for seven feet above the floors
          are of X£eene cement. Above this they are of
          white, hard surfaced plaster. There are no cor
          ners where a hose may not be turned. The white
          walls and the dark green trimmings are refreshing
          to their suggestions or cleanliness.
          Everything has been so arranged that the Im
          migrant passes through the station very much
          after the faanlon of a roll of paper through a web
          press. Upon landing at the pier he enters a pas
          sage which leads to the entrance of the examina
          tion building. Once Inside, the passage leads up a
          flight of broad stairs, which turn before reaching
          the second floor, and discharges Its contents onto
          the broad, open floor of the great vaulted examina
          tion room. Here the preliminary medical Inspec
          tion Is made. Th* immigrants Into whose physical
          condition there should be further examination are
          here weeded out and turned Into a room near by.
          The others go forward through numerous narrow
          aisles. These are the parting of the ways. As the
          Immigrants leave them they a;e separated accord
          tag to their destinations.
          THREE PASSAGES FOB EXIT.
          A stairway opens before the Immigrants as they
          leave the aisles. It Is divided into three passages
          by wire screens. Those for New-York now have
          free access to the covered passage to the New-
          York fern* Flip. Those who are to go away by rail
          are taken bark through the building past the ticket
          oSees and the big tt&ggaga room on the ground
          floor, where the, baggage has been assorted Into
          two divisions, that destined for New- York in one,
          ar.a that going out on the railroads in the other.
          The baggage for the railroads is properly checked,
          and the immigrants are then taken to a steam
          boat landing adjoining the one where they landed
          *n? «-re transported to the railroad stations.
          Those who are detained are ushered into a large
          room to remain until further disposition Is made
          ""them Rccord:rif, to the merits of their cases.
          The char.pe from the old station to the new one
          be a welcome one to the immigration officials,
          l w?' l make their work easiex and pleasanter,
          ¦no give thrm more cheerful quarters.

          international conference on immigration and emi
          gration. In hi* opinion, now is the time to act.
          lie cays:
          Ther* nssar has be*>n a. period when all the prin
          cipal countries of the world v.ere t>o deenly Inter
          «-st~d in the subject. Several of the leading Euro
          pean countries' have recently either parsed or in
          troduced In their legislatures immigration laws.
          astne of whifh are modelled practically after our

          the idea of adopting measures to discourage
          the *raS£TaUon of tbeir citizens or to indue* their re

          international arrangement and understanding lhat
          -ill work for the general good.
          T Commissioner points out further that, either
          through such an international conference or
          through amendments to this country's law*, ade
          quate provisions thould be made for the issuance
          '-•iaj»rica. By this means s=uch organizations as
          Black Hand Society could not gain a foothold
          Imbk, because the passport would have to bear the
          isccrd of the alien. It would do much, too, the
          Commist.oner believe*, to put an end to the "white
          »4*v*- traffic." although that even now Is under
          j reasonably good control by the immigration of

          Among the recommendations made by Commis
          inn" Sargent, many of which are administrative
          j in character, are the following:
          i That legislation should be enacted to check vio
          1 iHtion!= of the law by professed seamen.
          i nat marine hospital surgeons be stationed at the
          principal ports of embarkation abroad to examine
          aliens before th v start for America.
          i n surgeons and inspectors, male ani female, be
          placed on vessels of the principal steamship lines
          to examine incoming aliens.
          That arrangements be perfected for the detection
          or members of tho criminal classes who seek to
          come, to the United States.
          That a treaty be negotiated with Mexico respect
          ing immigration through that country: or. if that
          cannot hi- done, that the Mexican border be close.!
          to all except American citizens and bona fide resi
          dents of Mexico.
          That a harmonious arrangement be made with th«
          Canadian government respecting the enforcement of
          the immigration laws of that country and the United
          States.
          That immigration stations be erected at Boston,
          Philadelphia and Baltimore.
          That appropriations be made for improvements
          at Ellis Island. New York Angel Island, San Fran-
          Cisco, and Honolulu.

          Ellis Island
          Ends Operations
          NEW YORK, l^i—Ellis Island is
          closed after serving as the gateway to America for millions of immigrants during the past 62 years.
          The tiny island in New York harbor in recent years served chiefly
          as a place to keep deportees. Immigrant clearance abroad reduced
          the number detained on the island j
          to almost nothing.
          Last Friday the last of 50 persons
          still detained on the island were moved to the mainland and Edward J. Shaughnessy, district immigration director, said: "Business
          is closed.”
          The immigration service will
          keep a skeleton crew on Ellis. If
          New York City or some federal
          agency does not take over within a year, the island will revert to
          the government’s General Services
          Administration.

          LTHOUGH a great improve

          rangements that need to ex
          ist for the recep.ion of immi
          grants who landed at Castle Garden,
          Ellis Island, says the New York Recor
          der, is far from being a gateway that
          .would prepossess arrivals from Europe
          in favor of their adopted country.
          The island is tied around from dook
          to dook with miles of red tape. It is
          a fearfully tedious matter to land in
          America and a most unnecessary
          amount of fuss and feathers seems to
          accompany the entrance of a new ar
          rival into the land of freedom.
          A visit to Ellis Island, when the liv
          ing freight of two or tbree ocean
          steamers is being sifted through the
          various avenues leading to the boat
          that trasport8 ir to the Battery, pre
          sents so many phases that it is well
          worth braving the trip in an immi
          grant ferryboat from the Barge Office
          to see the sight. Around the big room
          in the centre of the principal build
          ing on Ellis Island where the sifting
          THE DETE
          process goes on rans a gallery, and
          from this a view of the whole interior
          can he obtained.
          The first stage through which the
          new arrivals pass iii the scrutiny of
          the medical oi?ser.s und the Ellis Isl
          and matrons. Having proven that
          they are free from physical defeuts
          the immigrants are o riven into fenced
          in passages leading io the registration
          officials.
          Through these fe aced avenues the
          unfortunate steerage passengers,
          wearing every variety of eccentric
          and un-American head-gear, and car
          rying as much portable baggage as
          they can stagger under, edge their
          way along foot by foot in the direc
          tion of the gate of hope through
          which alono they caa get to liberty.
          The procession slouches forward at
          the rate of about a foot in ten min
          utes, the delay being caused by the
          laborious attempts of the uniformed
          official tu extract the necessary infor
          mation regarding the incomer's birth
          and .parentage, etc
          Fortunately the official speaks an
          almost infinite variety of languages or
          tho task he has in hand would bc a
          well nigh hopeless one. AB it is, ow
          ing to the nervous condition of the
          immigrant, it usually takes an almost
          interminably long time to drag out
          an answer to the simplest question,
          j Everything has to bo repeated several
          times and explained in the minutest
          J detail and then occasionally the ques
          tioner has to give it up and turn the
          obtuse foreigner over to au assistant,
          j But somehow or other the line
          moves on. Each man and woman
          IMMIGRANTS AT TE
          hitches the family belongings along
          as the space betw?sn them and the
          man in the brass buttons decreases,
          and the hope that springs eternal in
          human breast buoys them up to be
          lieve that some time they will be able
          to pass the official who so jealously
          guards thc-entrance to the open space
          beyond. Ttn their hands the immi
          grants clutch the doouments handed
          to them on boar! ship, for all this
          questioning and registration at Ellis
          Island follows a preliminary cross-ex
          amination before the steerage passen
          gers are allowed to leave the ship.
          The immigrants are ticketed, too-a
          very necessary precaution, for there
          are several steamship line\ all landing
          passengers in a promiscuous mass, and
          without that ticket it would be a Her
          culean task to sep irate one lot from
          the other. So, ticketed and registered
          and served with documents and cross
          examined and pushed and jostled into
          place in the line, the hopeful refugee
          from monarchy-riciden Europe travels
          slowly into thu premised land.
          When the immigrant has passed suc
          cessfully through the ordeal of an
          swering the sharp catechism of the j
          official at tho top of the laue, he is
          handed to the mercies of tho crowd on
          the outside and thenceforth becomes
          common property at tho mercy of
          hotel and boardinghouse runners, rail
          road agentd, well meaaing but offi
          cious missionaries, restaurant keeper*,
          and if he ba lucky enough to have
          theni, relatives nu I friends
          He is u luckies* wight during this
          period of his transition tocitizeuhood.
          First of al), ho must change hit
          money. This can bo clone at the
          island, -where a firm of money brokers
          his purchased the solo right to money
          changing. The immigrants* savings
          are brought from all sorts of extraor
          dinary biding placee, sometimes from
          the depths of stockings, from the* in
          side of waists, where nothing short ol
          a knife or a pair of scissors CHU secure
          its release, from shoes and belts, and
          even from the mouth.
          To watch Money Changer Scully at
          work is one of the most interesting
          sights on the island. The rapidity
          with which he changes into current
          coin of the republio Russian roubles,
          Italian lire, German marks, French
          franc?, English sovereigns and Aus
          trian florins is marvelous. Only one
          glance seems necessary, and the band
          goes down into oue of tho well-filled
          cash drawers. Two or three eeconds
          later and the amount of exchange lies
          before the immigrant with a paper
          showing how much has been exchanged,
          and the bewildered foreigner is told
          to stand back to make room for the
          next applicant. He might as well
          take it for granted that the amount is
          correct (as, of course, it is) for, if he
          looked at it with that air of stunned
          stupidity for au hour, he would not
          know anything more about tho strange
          money than before. Occasionally one
          holder than the rest will make an at
          tempt to challenge the accuraoy oi
          the amount given him, upon which an
          attache of the money changer's office
          unios PEN.
          will take the coins from the immi
          grant's hand and explain the value ot
          each as he drops it baok again. It is
          wasted time, however, as the owner of
          the money is left in as bad condition
          of dense ignorance a*3 ever.
          Money will buy things on Ellis
          Island and the proprietors of tbe
          lunch counter?, where bologna and
          bread appear to be the staple articles
          of food, aro at liberty now to cuargo
          on the mob made hungry by the long
          wait in the lines. The scouts for
          these lunoh counters are indefatiga
          ble workers and certainly earn their
          money. The wonder is, from thc way
          in which the immigrants are almost
          dragged to the bologua counters, that
          some one does nob get hurt in the
          scrimmage. If the greenhorn gets
          through the experience all right and
          survives the bologna, lot him brace up
          to resist the onslaught of the railroad
          agents, who will bear him off bodily if
          he does not keep a sharp look out.
          In this neutral ground at Ellis
          Island the scene ou a busy day is be
          wildering and distracting. The offi
          cials do their be3t to keep the mixed
          mass of humanity in something liko
          order, but with so many nationalities,
          with excited men and women running
          around looking for their baggage and
          for each other, children crying and
          relatives and friends all chorusing a
          welcome together in various lan
          guages, it is no wonder that the scene
          looks like a pocket edition of pande
          monium.
          As fast as possible the immigrants
          are hnstled into the ferry boats and
          transported to the Battery, and grad
          [E LUNOH COUNTER.
          nally the island is deserted by all save
          tho tired offisials and tho detained im
          migrants.
          A sorry-looking orowd is this last.
          From the detention pen they watch
          the fortunate ones who .pass the bar
          rier with envious eyes, looking eager
          ly at every stranger who approaches
          them to see if there is not some hope
          coming from ?some where. In all the
          driven and badgered crowd that passes
          to the boats there is none which is not
          light-hearted, for tho red tape ordeal
          is over. The prisoners in the deten
          tion pen have nothing to buoy them
          up. After eoming all this way to reach
          this land of promise, they get only a
          glimpse and are sent baok to the wil
          derness again.
          One ol the queerest personages on
          the island is the barber. It is hardly
          correct to call his place a shop, for it
          is merely a corner of the big room
          where tho barber has placed a chair
          and hung up a mirror and a towel or
          two. Judging from the condition of
          tho majority of tue immigrants, the
          barber is au institution sadly needed
          at Ellis Island, but few seem to utilize
          his services, advertised at the prices
          of twenty cents for a hair cut and ten
          cents for a shave.
          The crematory at Ellis Idand is an
          other very necessary acsos?ory. Jt is
          not intended for the cremation ot hu
          man bodies, but merely to give the
          clothing of suspicions arrivals a thor
          ough chance to shake ott any disagree
          able associations with infectious dis
          ease or obnoxious insects.
          Fairly good arrangements appear to
          i have been made for the bonsivg cf
          i immigrants who are compelled to stay
          i on tho island over night, tue old pow
          THE BARBER'S CHAIR.
          der magazines having been converted I
          into comfortable sleeping rooms.
          One of tho worst Bourses of annoy
          anoe to the officials are the crowd of
          relations that flock to Ellis Island to
          meet incoming passengers. They are
          always in the most intense state of ox
          citement and it is all that the gate
          keepers can do to prevent them break
          ing down the barriers in the mad rash
          to get inside of the enclosnre.
          There being no police on the island
          it is necessary for the officials to take
          the law into their own hands and
          maintain order by force. It wonld
          be a decided improvement if some of
          the strongest and most reliable mea
          on the island were sworn in to act as
          special policemen.
          An old landmark of the island is
          gradually yielding to the infirmitses
          of age. This is the historical tree on
          which the pirates, Hicks, Wormsley
          and Gibbs, were hanged when the*
          place was known as Ellis Island. The
          tree was damaged during tue storms
          of last winter, and has recently been
          broken off short by the wind. All that
          is left of the tree now is about seven
          feet of bare trunk, and this the Eliis
          Island gardener is making every effort
          i to preserve.
